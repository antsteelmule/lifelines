# lifelines
In this documentation you will find all information about my project "lifelines", which was part of the seminar "Input/Output Fundamentals of Process-Oriented Design". The course took place during the winter semster '15/'16 and was supervised by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. 
In this documentation you can follow the whole process from my first analog algorithm to a physical product, with a lot of experiments in between.
