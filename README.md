# lifelines
In this documentation you will find all information about my project "lifelines", which was part of the seminar "Input/Output Fundamentals of Process-Oriented Design". The course took place during the winter semster '15/'16 and was supervised by Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. 

Following an overview of the main issues and the resulting works: 
1- Algorithms (analog-digital-adaption): LINK/ LIFELINES
2- Datavisualization (of the International Space Station Data): LINK/ ENCOUNTERS IN SPACE
3- Physical Computing (creation of a modular chain): LINK/ TRANSL8R
