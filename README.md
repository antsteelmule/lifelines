# lifelines
In this documentation you will find all information about my project "lifelines", which was part of the seminar "Input/Output Fundamentals of Process-Oriented Design". The course took place during the winter semster '15/'16 and was supervised by Fabian Morón Zirfas at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. 
In this documentation you can follow the whole process from my first analog algorithm to a physical product, with a lot of experiments and thoughts in between.

Part 1 | Analog Algorithm
----------

Inspired by works of the us-amercian conceptual artist [Sol LeWitt] (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt), we started with writing an analog algorithm and giving it to our course-mates to follow the writtten instructions.

###### Algorithm Number One

  Original text:
  schwarz gefärbtes wasser.
  zeichne eine möglichst lange linie.
  
  English translation:
  black colored water.
  draw a preferably long line.
  
###### Algorithm Number One: Results
